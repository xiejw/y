## Practice I Follow

### Programming Language

Simplicity matters. Any thing I wrote should be readable and revisable without
too much cognitive load. So, I use `Go` and `c` for most programmings.

#### Notes Markups

Among `markdown`, vim `help`, and `LaTeX`, I choose `markdown` due to
simplicity, appearance (easy to view on GitHub), and extensiveness. The final
point is due to `RAG`. I could easily break down `Markdown` files and build a
RAG bot for that.
