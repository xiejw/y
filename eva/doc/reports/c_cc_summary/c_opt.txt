BRANCH PREDICTION

In short, for static branch prediction

- A forward branch defaults to not taken
- A backward branch defaults to taken

In order to effectively write your code to take advantage of these rules, when
writing if-else or switch statements, check the most common cases first and
work progressively down to the least common
