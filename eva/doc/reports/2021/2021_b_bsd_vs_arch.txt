OVERVIEW

FreeBSD          A comprehensive, solid and fast system for server OS. Both
                 kernel and userland are in one repository:

                     https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src

                 Use 'rc(8)' for services management, with excellent
                 documentation

                     https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/config/#configtuning-rcd

                 All userland files are in '/usr' and '/etc' while all ports
                 files are located at '/usr/local' and '/usr/local/etc'. See
                 'hier(7)'.

                 Super high quality of documentations, including both handbook
                 and man pages

                     https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi

                 Ports allows users to configure the software and enable
                 or disable to features to fit the real need. This is really
                 great if you know what you want!

Arch Linux       A Linux distribution adheres to the KISS principle. Ships
                 software as released by the original developers (upstream)
                 with minimal distribution-specific (downstream) changes.

                 Use 'systemd' -- a big red flag IMO. But most of the services
                 are disabled by default. The wiki page is here

                     https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd

                 Use Linux Kernel with a (truely) minimal package set to
                 define a basic Arch Linux installation, called 'base' (meta
                 package)

                     https://archlinux.org/packages/core/any/base/

                 Super high quality of wiki as documantations.

                     https://wiki.archlinux.org/

                 Man pages are reusing the Linux man pages project (install
                 'man-db' and 'man-pages')

BASE

FreeBSD defines base as the userland of OS.

    https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd-src

Arch Linux installs the following list as 'base'.

>
    bash
    bzip2
    coreutils   // The basic file, shell and text manipulation utilities of
                // the GNU operating system, e.g., ls, wc, etc
    file
    filesystem  // Base Arch Linux files, e.g., /bin, /etc/passwd, etc
    findutils   // GNU utilities to locate files, e.g., find, xargs
    gawk
    gcc-libs
    gettext
    glibc
    grep
    gzip
    iproute2    // IP Routing Utilities, a collection of userspace utilities
                // for controlling and monitoring various aspects of
                // networking in the Linux kernel, including routing, network
                // interfaces, tunnels, traffic control, and network-related
                // device drivers.
    iputils     // Network monitoring tools, including ping
    licenses    // Standard licenses distribution package
    pacman
    pciutils    // PCI bus configuration space access library and tools, e.g.,
                // lspci
    procps-ng   // Utilities for monitoring your system and its processes,
                // e.g., top, ps, etc
    psmisc      // Miscellaneous procfs tools, e.g., killall, pstree
    sed
    shadow      // Password and account management tool suite with support for
                // shadow files and PAM, e.g., passwd, useradd.
    systemd
    systemd-sysvcompat
    tar
    util-linux  // Miscellaneous system utilities for Linux. e.g., dmesg,
                // fdisk, mount, etc.  A standard package distributed by the
                // Linux Kernel Organization for use as part of the Linux
                // operating system
    xz

KERNEL

FreeBSD builds its own kernel. Resources to learn/hack

    Handbook:
      https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/kernelconfig/

    Book:
      Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System, The 2nd Edition
      https://www.amazon.com/Design-Implementation-FreeBSD-Operating-System/dp/0321968972/

    WWW:
      http://www.watson.org/~robert/freebsd/reading/

Arch Linux uses Linux Kernel. It is a perfect platform for testing vanilla
(Linux) kernel. No patches needed and no hidden kernel related hooks installed
by the distribution. So we can hack almost everything and understand each of
them. Resources to learn/hack

    Arch Wiki:
      https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Kernel/Traditional_compilation

      Linux Kernel Programming: A comprehensive guide to kernel internals,
        writing kernel modules, and kernel synchronization

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGES

FreeBSD uses ports. It also support pkg, binary-based package system.

    Handbook:
      https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/ports/
      https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/porters-handbook/

    Man Pages:
      man ports
      less /usr/ports/Mk/bsd.options.mk

FreeBSD has its own java port. https://www.freebsd.org/java/

Arch Linux uses mainly binary packages via 'pacman'. The downside is it
does not offer option to turn off features (which is provided by
'./configure'). But this is a hard problem for almost all Linux distribution
(except Gentoo). However, for certainly large package, e.g., Java, compiling it
without X11 is not possible; but stripping x11 '.so' files is easy, so headless
binary file can be provided (see content of jre11-openjdk-headless).
