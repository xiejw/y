### What's Zion

Zion is the foundational library for all my projects. While it currently starts
as a C++-only project, it may expand to support other languages and ecosystems
in the future.

Goals:
- Serve as a centralized repository for shared/common libraries.
- Provide unified language support infrastructure in a single location.
